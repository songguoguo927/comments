This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app]( https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/).🌝

## Available Scripts

在本项目中可以运行以下命令跑起来

`npm install`
`npm start`
🍁默认在本地浏览器3000端口打开，更改文件可热加载更新。报错的话会在控制台中打印出来

`npm test`
- [ ] unknown for me
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`

**Note:该操作不可逆**

如果你对该构建工具活配置选项不满意，你可以任意时候eject，它会从你的项目中移除the single build dependency

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
